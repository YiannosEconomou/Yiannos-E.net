	<p><i><font color="#428307">It would seem then that the idea that humans are the only story-telling animals is by no means an unproblematic 
		reflection of reality. It is something that some people like to believe, 
		just as some once believed that most humans were brutes and thus incapable of making meaning. 
		It is, in other words, a construct , one that is intmately connected with structures of power and with the forceful repression 
		of the awareness of nonhuman forms of agency and expression. 
		Not surprisingly, in this matter, too, the hand of power has often fallen hardest on Indigenous people.</p>

		It is perfectly possible, then, that far from being an exclusively human attribute, the narrative 
			faculty is the most animal of human abilities, a product of one of the traits that humans indisputably share
			with animals and many other beings â€“ attachemnts to place. Perhaps, then, story telling, far from setting humans apart from animals,
			is actually the most imprtant residue of our formely wild selves.</p>
