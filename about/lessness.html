	<p><h2> LESSNESS (2020)</h2>
	<p>"Lessness" by Samuel Becket is treated in this video, as it is often the case, like the literary equivalent of modernist abstract art, lacking any narrative, 
  character, or the physical presence of any life - even in the form of a voice-over. Faithfully sparse, the imagery is drawn from other late proses by the author 
  as well, and though the whole piece is presented in captions, the linearity occasionally breaks down, challenging even the fastest reader.  
  The whole venture appears to be set in the realm of thought as it oscillates between the nebular and the solid, geometry and turbulence, the static and the moving.
