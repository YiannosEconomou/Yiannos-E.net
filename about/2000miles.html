<p>Photography as the looking glass, through which there is a gate to a wonder land of time and space travel. A photographer is turned into a living 
	photograph by his camera – two dimensional being in a three-dimensional world. This fragmented universe has no longer a unified single point perspective, 
	nor is it dualistic mirror reflection of two parallel worlds – it is a multi-layered collage of life at various levels. Distorted, made up between fantasy
	and reality, it re-addresses the use of photography to reproduce not reality itself but the desired version of it. The haunted landscapes can become a refuge
	and a labyrinth, an escape route and a trap. Yet crossing the line remained beyond reach. 
<p>Music: Fiona Mitchel and Graham Pilgrim
