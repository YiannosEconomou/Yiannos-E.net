<p>

<p> . </p> 
<p>The photography exhibition "BioGeoMetries" by Yiannos Economou, follows the video installation 
Therianthropes, shown in Nicosia in May 2022, to an extent the video "Lessness" 2020, and the exhibition "Sonitus Urbanitatis" 
in Paphos, December 2019, dealing with the dangerously dysfunctional relationship between humans and nature. The photographs 
were initially taken as visual research on this theme, developing, as it progressed, into an autonomous project.  </p>
<p>
The architectural urban environment, denoting stability, and balance is juxtaposed with the fluidity of the environments 
of other lifeforms, and more specifically that of the migratory arctic terns. The geometric rationalisation of anthropogenic 
space reveals a desire for order and control, not only for nature but for humans too, in contrast with the turbulent and chaotic 
ocean surface and atmospheric winds, where the birds spend most of their time. In between these two lies a third topos, that of the 
human-made ruins, which undermines the illusion of invincibility and timelessness of our species and creations. </p>
<p>
The photographs were taken over a period of ten years in Iceland, Hungary, Bulgaria, England, Greece, and Austria.</p> 
<p>Curated by Dr. Nadja Stamselberg</p>
<p> All photographs are limited editions of 10, printed giclee on paper. </p>
<p> If you would like to acquire a print please follow the link,  <a href="/GeoBioMetriesOrders">GeoBioMetries Details</a>, or contact the artist.

<p> I think as I move through space, as I direct my gaze through the camera, I change positions and angles, I focus on objects and 
	set the exposure time, as my body, extended by the lens, changes points of view and scope of vision, I think with my body, 
	like octopus think with their tentacles.   </p>

<p>These photographs are like drawings, drawing as research or as a way of thinking.
None of these images are preconceived yet nothing is accidental.   </p>

<p> One could assume that since these are depictions of spaces and not actions, 
	the luxury of time and the careful choice of position and angle is available. 
	But moving through space is equally pressing, the opportune moments arise and disappear equally fast. 
	Photography without lighting sets, tripods or models, is always instinctive.   </p>

<p> Modern neurology has shown that there is more than one pathway of vision, not only the one we know about but also
	a more primitive one which our conscious does not register. It is a faster and more accurate circuit that is 
	running hidden below the surface,  it is the one that helps us drive cars, play tennis, and catch balls on air without thinking.
	And click the shutter button of the camera at the right moment, with our index finger, the virtuoso of our five digits, as any 
	pianist or video gamer will testify.  </p>

<p> <i>This is a direct refutation of the idea that we are outside the world looking in, deciding which choice to make, of the Neoplatonic 
	Christian idea, that we have a mind-like or soul-like thing that is somehow inside us like a gas in a bottle, 
	totally different from that bottle in some way, and that it is a sort of puppet master pulling the strings. </i></p>

<p> In pristine shiny, translucent, contemporary architecture, with no tangible surfaces, no wear and tear,

<p> The migratory arctic terns travel more than any other bird or animal every year, covering  about 90,000 km per year, 
	from the arctics to antarctica and back, spending most of their time above the everchanging, protean, surface of the ocean.
They are insecure, clumsy, and aggressive in their solid nesting grounds, but comfortable and elegant on air, they even 
	sleep while flying, taking advantage of the 
atmospheric currents. .  </p>
