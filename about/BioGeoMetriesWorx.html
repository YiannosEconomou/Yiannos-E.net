<p>The photography exhibition "BioGeoMetries" by Yiannos Economou, follows the video installation 
Therianthropes, shown in Nicosia in May 2022, to an extent the video "Lessness" 2020, and the exhibition "Sonitus Urbanitatis" 
in Paphos, December 2019, dealing with the dangerously dysfunctional relationship between humans and nature. The photographs 
were initially taken as visual research on this theme, developing, as it progressed, into an autonomous project.  </p>
<p>
The architectural urban environment, denoting stability, and balance is juxtaposed with the fluidity of the environments 
of other lifeforms, and more specifically that of the migratory arctic terns. The geometric rationalisation of anthropogenic 
space reveals a desire for order and control, not only for nature but for humans too, in contrast with the turbulent and chaotic 
ocean surface and atmospheric winds, where the birds spend most of their time. In between these two lies a third topos, that of the 
human-made ruins, which undermines the illusion of invincibility and timelessness of our species and creations. </p>
<p>
The photographs were taken over a period of ten years in Iceland, Hungary, Bulgaria, England, Greece, and Austria.</p> 
<p>Curated by Dr. Nadja Stamselberg</p>
<p> All photographs are limited editions of 10, printed giclee on paper. </p>

<p> I think as I move through space, as I direct my gaze through the camera, I change positions and angles, I focus on objects and 
	set the exposure time, as my body, extended by the lens, changes points of view and scope of vision, I think with my body, 
	like octopus think with their tentacles.   </p>

<p> The camera is an extension of the eye, and the eye is an extension of
	the brain, and all, organic and inorganic parts, are entangled into one entity. </p>

<p>These photographs are like drawings, drawing as research or as a way of thinking.
None of these images are preconceived yet nothing is accidental.   </p>

<p>TOne could assume that since these are depictions of spaces and not actions, 
	the luxury of time and the careful choice of position and angle is available. 
	But moving through space is equally pressing, the opportune moments arise and disappear equally fast. 
	Photography without lighting sets, tripods or models, is always instinctive.   </p>
