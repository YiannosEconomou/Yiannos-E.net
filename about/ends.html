	<p><h2> THE MORPHING APHRODITE (2017 - 2021)</h2>
	<p>The work takes as a starting point the fact that Cyprus culture, like all, is a plexus of disparate elements that transfuse 
		through various epochs and cross through geographical borders, in altered forms, but maintaining their essence intact. 
		But Cyprus bears one cultural characteristic which, as archaeologists VasosKarageorgis and Jacklin Karagiorgis note, 
		can be traced from the dawn of civilisation in the island to this day: a female spiritual presence.</p> <p>Extracts from texts 
	by the two academics, as well as by Marie-Louise Winbladh, and M. Ohnefalsch-Richter.
