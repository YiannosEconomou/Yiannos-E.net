	<p><h2> Je Prens D'Amour(2020)</h2></p>

<p>In 1936, Daphne Du Maurier visited Cyprus to have a short respite from the heat of Egypt where her husband – a British Army officer - was stationed and stayed for a few weeks at Forest Parks Hotel at the mountains of Cyprus. At this marvel of early 20th century modernity in the heart of a British colony the author started working on the dark novel, Rebecca, turned into a film by Alfred Hitchcock.  To homage to that event, the Fine Art Department of the Cyprus University of Technology, in collaboration with the hotel management and the local community, organised a art intervention on the space of the hotel.

The video presented by Yiannos Economou has two points of departure: One is the distinctively discernible influence of the living, natural and social landscape of the area in “Rebecca”. The other is the trajectory of two impressively similar, if not identical musical pieces with origins going back at least 600 years age at the Palace of King Janos of Nicosia. The well-known folk “Song of the Shepherd” and “Je Prens D’ Amour” as it was reserved through the centuries, unchanged in the Torino Manuscripts. Two different gazes interweave, the dramatized and structured one of the visitor-colonialist, and the other, the sunburnt and vulnerable, that of the people of the soil, in an endless but creative flux.
