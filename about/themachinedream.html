	<p><h2> The Machine Dream [2005]</h2></p>
	
	<p><h3>Dutration: 6 min.<p></h3></p>
<p><b>Music: Written and performed by Galina Dimova-Georgieva</p></b>

<p>The machine dream is a digitally made short film, in the old silent movie style – featuring images, captions and piano music only. Though different in form and content, 
	it alludes to the way that digital technology and the internet supplant cinema as the main outlet of dreams and fantasies. It is the story 
	of someone who invents a way to digitally re-master his memories, only to find that he is part of a huge pool of people who re-construct their 
	fantasies in an impersonal and detached way, on the edge between beauty and a “bad trip” experience
