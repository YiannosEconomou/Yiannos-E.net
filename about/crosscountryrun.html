	<p><h2> Cross-country Run [2004]</h2></p>
<p> Duration: 8 min 46 sec</p>
<p>A blue silhouette of a man runs through a disjointed space, never interacting with the floating landscape. The imaginary landscape passes through the screen 
	from right to left faking motion, wrapped in a bell-shaped musical piece by Philip Glass. No distance will be covered. 
	This is a tracking shot without any real movement. </p>

<p>Some of the fragments depicted, -construction sites, traffic and bulldozers- connote a time of upheavals. Others, like the leaves, 
	electricity pylons and cable, the wind blowing through torn flags and a blown up Santa Claus suggest a rootlessness, the absence 
	of a firm attachment to reality. The place could be anywhere but all these images originated in Pafos. This man, taken from photographs
	shot more than a dozen decades ago, does not belong here. Rootless, insular, unseeing and unseen, he is a cut out, and cut off from his
	history, his culture and his project. </p>
