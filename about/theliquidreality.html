<p><h2> THE LIqUID REALITY </h2></p>
<p>Photography 1998 - 2002</p>
<p><img scr="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65823818/88827977-45593400-d1d3-11ea-8826-e0ebe553a81d.jpg">
<p>This work evolves around the idea of a fluid perception of reality. 
	We live in a world of solids yet our experience f it is liquid. 
	We live within time, in a flux hence our existence and our environment changes continuously form, 
	like liquid or gas. In this respect we are like aquatic creatures. </p>
<p>This series of photographs employs a form of multiple exposures with shifting points of focus, all taken with the narrowest depth of field. 
	The result is similar to pictures taken with special filters, giving a misty aura to objects. But this result is brought about by 
	incorporating time into the frame, it is a form of multiple perspective where the point of view shifts in depth rather than angle. Sharp, 
	long depth of field photography can claim a better representation of objective reality but leaves the liquid reality behind./p<>
