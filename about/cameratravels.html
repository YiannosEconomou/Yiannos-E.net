	<p><h2> CAMERA TRAVELS</h2>
<p> A video that discusses the ability of images to exercise social criticism given the power that the producers of such visual (or other) 
	discourse posses. Such a criticism can only be effective if issues of subjectivity, authorship and the mechanics of such productions 
	are taken into consideration.
	<p>Its theme evolves around the projections of self images by two disparate groups that live in Cyprus, 
		the artists and the third world immigrants who share a nomadic way of living, brought about for different reasons. </p>
