	<p><h2> AFTERNOON ECHOES</h2></p>
<p>Afternoon Echoes is a reversal of the way film and video use sound. It was produced specifically for the International Video art Exhibition “The Mirror Stage” [cur. 
	Yiannis Colakidis] which evolved around the familiar 
	Lacanian concept of identity formation.
	<p>In this piece the image is more or less static and belongs to a background mode, with the suggestion of a story, time or place done primarily 
		through a fragmented but seamless sound. There is only a slight imperceptible distortion on the picture, similar to the imperceptible 
		distortion that sound designers do so often on sound and always get away with.
