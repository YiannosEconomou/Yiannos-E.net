	<p><h2> THERIANTHROPES (2022)</h2></p>
  <h3><p><b>A Video Composition in Five Acts</p></b></h3>
  
  
	<p>This project, like many others currently, is a product of the new - post-pandemic and pre-environmental crisis - realities, a discernible trend, 
  if not a total shift, in global perceptions. What is important is the cultural attitude of a - possibly religious - practice and not the artefacts, 
  which depict creatures that are half human and half animals, known as Therianthrope, such as the Minotaur or Anubis. It signifies a self-perception of 
  human society as an equal component with the rest of nature, a non-privileged group among many others living on the planet, in an arrangement of 
  interdependence. This prehistoric state of non-separation between sapiens and the rest of the fauna and flora is becoming again essential for the 
  survival of humanity, and the avoidance of major disasters in our biosphere. The awakening sensation that we are not invincible leads to the 
  opportunity of a new, spectacular, albeit simpler, world with infinite possibilities and new pleasures, out of our techno-consumerist cave. </p>

<p>One could regard this video installation as belonging to the genre of landscape painting in the classical sense. Movement, sound, 
multiple screens and mechanically reproduced images and sounds are of course used, which formally differentiates it from a painting on canvas, 
but in principle it is expected to be viewed by static spectators in a standard indoor gallery set up. This contrasts with the interactivity, 
the use of natural elements such as sunlight, raw natural materials and objects, or even living organisms that contemporary environmental 
and land artists employ. However natural and human elements interaction have been incorporated into the work, often in serendipitous mode, 
such as the acting up of aggression by the arctic terns, and the dialogue between he chirping of the birds and the birds.

It also follows Joseph Beuys,’ and other artists’ turn to radical ecology, but diverges from the Symbolist and Surrealist depiction of animals 
and therianthropes as mysteries, subconscious threats, the “Other”, and who had a lasting impact on artists such as Francis Bacon and Louise Bourgeois (the Spiders) later. In popular culture it is the horror movies or quasi horror movies, such as the Birds, (for which there is an unintentional reference in the work) that demonised animals. And certainly, Therianthropes goes against the unethical exploitation of living things by Damian Hirst.
