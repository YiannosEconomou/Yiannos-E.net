	<h1>Yiannos Economou</h1>
	<p>Born in Cyprus in 1959, 
		he studied Economics in the UK but re-entered full time education and obtained a Fine Arts Degree and a Masters from 
		the Kent Institute of Art and design in Kent, 1993. Whilst mainly a video artist, he has also worked with film, photography and animation and his videos have been shown equally in gallery spaces and video festivals. 
		His late works combine the raw verisimilar attributes of video and its ability to capture unmediated sounds and images into poetic compositions.
